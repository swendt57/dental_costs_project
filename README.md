## Dental Cost Comparison bewteen San Diego, California and Tijuana, Mexico

San Diego and Tijuana are on either side of the USA/Mexico international border. Due to this proximity, I know of many people, especially 
those without insurance, who go to Tijuana for their dental work. (Years ago, I was one of those people.) I thought it would be 
interesting to compare the costs of basic services.

After researching on the Internet, I decided to start with Yelp's Top Ten Most Affordable Dentists in San Diego and in Tijuana.

I am using real data whenever possible, however, many dentists, especially those on the US affordable list, are reticent 
to share any figures on the phone. Due to this, I have had to insert fake data but I will mark it as such.

Since this is a school project, and the main purpose is to show that I can create engaging interactive websites, and after 
checking with my mentor, I am proceeding as described above.
